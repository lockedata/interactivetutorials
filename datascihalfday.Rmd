## Business Challenge
### Business Challenge/goal
You should have some sort of company goal or challenge that needs to be tackled e.g.

- Increase customer profitability
- Increase quantity of customers
- Reduce overheads

```{r challengequiz}
quiz(
  question("Which of these is not a *good* reason to do data science?",
    answer("Everyone's doing it", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Add value"),
    answer("Advance company capabilities"),
    answer("Try new ways to solve problems")
  )
)
```

### Data science challenge
Once you have a business challenge, you can work with the business to find a lever you can push on. This lever / activity should change a behaviour and as a result help with the business goal e.g.

- offering incentives to stay with the company
- better targeted advertising to increase uptake
- identifying anomalous activity so people can investigate

Find the lever you can push on to change behaviours that helps with business goal.

### Getting started
#### Tips
- Pick something only somewhat important and valuable to begin
- Find many levers

### Getting started
#### Tips
- Iterate
- Prototype

#### Next steps

- Check out [MSFT data science process](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/learning-paths/data-science-process/)

## Data & EDA
### Data
- Do you have enough data?
- What biases are in the data that you might end up reinforcing?
  - For example, if you held individual customer level data, be prepared to explore their age and gender.
  - Was the data you hold gathered for this specific purpose (unlikely) or for no purpose at all? Is it all relevant?
- Have there been changes over time that mean the information means different things?
- Does it actually measure what you think it's measuring?
  - It is always worth looking into the definitions of how each variable was created if it isn't your data.

### Extra data
- Where can you get extra information from?
  - Consider the scales that this data is collected at, is it at the same level? Can it be aggregated up to your level?
- Do the join criteria work?
- Will you be able to get it for production purposes?

### Exploration
- Analyse the heck out of that data!
- Create extra "features"
- Descriptive statistics, such as histograms to understand the spread of the data are a great starting point.

### Get data
You can get data from many sources including databases. This can be data you or your company have collected for other purposes, open source data such as the census, or data that you have bought to improve your analysis, like credit scores or survey responses. 


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

driver = "ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server"
server = "lockedata.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
database = "datasci"
uid = "example"
pwd = "HBBFSE"


dbConn <- dbConnect(odbc(), driver = driver, server = server, database = database, 
    uid = uid, pwd = pwd)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

dbConnector<-function(local){
server = "lockedata.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
database = "datasci"
uid = "example"
pwd = "HBBFSE"

  if(local){
    dbConnect(odbc(), 
              driver = "ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server",
              server = server, database = database, 
              uid = uid, pwd = pwd)
    
  }else{
  dbConnect(
  odbc(),
  Driver   = "FreeTDS",
  Database = database,
  Uid      = uid,
  Pwd      = pwd,
  Server     = server,
  Port     = 1433,
  TDS_Version=7.4
)
  }
  
}

dbConn <- dbConnector(!sa)
```

Change this code to get the `chicagofood` table instead of `iris`.
```{r getdata, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
iris <- dbGetQuery(dbConn, "select * from iris")
summary(iris)
```

```{r getdata-hint}
chicagofood <- dbGetQuery(dbConn, "select * from chicagofood")
summary(chicagofood)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chicagofood <- dbGetQuery(dbConn, "select * from chicagofood")

chicagofood %>% 
  mutate(
         pastSerious = pmin(pastSerious, 1),
         pastCritical = pmin(pastCritical, 1),
         ageAtInspection = ifelse(ageAtInspection > 4, 1L, 0L),
         heat_burglary = pmin(heat_burglary, 70),
         heat_sanitation = pmin(heat_sanitation, 70),
         heat_garbage = pmin(heat_garbage, 50),
         criticalFound=pmin(1, criticalCount),
         fail_flag=fail_flag) %>% 
  select(-pass_flag)->
  chicagofood
```

### Data exploration
Explore data in tabular and graphical formats. 

Get a summary of values.

```{r summary, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
summary(iris)
```

```{r summary-hint, exercise.eval=TRUE}
summary(chicagofood)
```

Produce bivariate views of data to see which fields are most predictive.

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

chicagofood %>% 
  count(fail_flag, Inspector_Assigned) %>% 
  group_by(Inspector_Assigned) %>% 
  mutate(prop=scales::percent(n/sum(n))) %>%
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(fail_flag,prop)
```

Look at the fail rate by `Facility_Type`.

```{r analysedata, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.lines = 10}
```

Build visualisations to view distributions of data.
```{r echo=TRUE}
chicagofood %>% 
  group_by(Month=lubridate::month(Inspection_Date),Facility_Type) %>% 
  summarise(failrate=mean(fail_flag)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Month, failrate, 
             group=Facility_Type, colour=Facility_Type))+
  geom_line()
```

Look at fail rates over time split out by whether they are hold a mobile license or not.
```{r plotdata, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.lines = 10}
```

### Getting started
#### Tips
- Data dictionaries or metadata give you a wealth of information about the contents, format and structure of the data.
- Code everything

#### Next steps
- Read R for Data Science [geni.us/rfords](//geni.us/rfords)
- Use your existing tools

## Sampling
### Sampling basics
- [OPTIONAL] Dataset for missing data
- Dataset for building your model
- Dataset for testing your model

Create samples for our modelling exercise. Revise this code to create and store samples for your `chicagofood` data.

```{r sample, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
library(modelr)

iris %>% 
  resample_partition(c("train"=.7, "test"=.3)) ->
  irissample

irissample %>% 
  pluck("train") ->
  iris_train

irissample %>% 
  pluck("test") ->
  iris_test
```


```{r sample-hint}
library(modelr)

chicagofood %>% 
  resample_partition(c("train"=.7, "test"=.3)) ->
  chicagofoodsample

chicagofoodsample %>% 
  pluck("train") ->
  chicagofood_train

chicagofoodsample %>% 
  pluck("test") ->
  chicagofood_test
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(modelr)

chicagofood %>% 
  resample_partition(c("train"=.7, "test"=.3)) ->
  chicagofoodsample

chicagofoodsample %>% 
  pluck("train") ->
  chicagofood_train

chicagofoodsample %>% 
  pluck("test") ->
  chicagofood_test
```

### Considerations
- Balanced or unbalanced
  **What is balanced or unbalanced? In what context?
- Bootstrapping
  - This is a method other than confidence intervals to estimate a population parameter through random sampling with replacement. i.e. the computer does it over and over and over so that you don't have to! 


### Getting started
#### Tips
- Make samples reproducible
- Don't double-dip!

#### Next steps
- Read about [sampling](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/designing-studies/sampling-methods-stats/a/sampling-methods-review)

## Modelling
### Models
- Pattern classification can be grouped into two main subcategories: Supervised and unsupervised. 
  - In supervised learning, the class labels which are used to build the classification model are known, and this information is used to train a model to classify new data entries.  
  - In unsupervised learning, classes are unlabelled and have to be inferred from an unstructured dataset. This typically uses a clustering method to group the unlabeled samples based on similarity (or distance) measures.
  
There's a great [blog post by Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_intro_supervised_learning.html) which gives a detailed explanation of the differences, and then gives a brilliant description of a typical supervised learning workflow. Take a look! 

- Parametric vs non-parametric
  - A learning model that summarizes data with a set of parameters of fixed size (independent of the number of training examples) is called a parametric model. No matter how much data you throw at a parametric model, it won’t change its mind about how many parameters it needs.
  
  - Examples of parametric models include:
    + Logistic regression
    + Linear Discriminant Analysis
    + Naive Bayes
    + Simple Neural Networks
  
  - Benefits of parametric models 
    + They are simple and results are easier to interpret
    + They are fast
    + They work on imperfect data, and don't require as much training data
    
  - Limitations of parametric models 
    + They are constrained by their functional form
    + They are better suited to simpler problems
    + Poor fitting
  
  - Nonparametric methods are good when you have a lot of data and no prior knowledge, and when you don’t want to worry too much about choosing just the right features. They seek to best fit the training data, whilst also maintaining some ability to generalise unseen data. 
  
  -Examples of non-parametric models
    + k-Nearest Neighbour
    + Decision trees
    + Support Vector Machines
    
  - Benefits of non-parametric models
    + They are felxible and capable of fitting a large number of functional forms
    + No assumptions about the underlying functions
    + Can result in higher performance models for prediction
    
  - Limitations of non-parametric models
    + They require a lot more training data
    + They are slower
    + There is more of a risk of overfitting the training data and it is harder to explain why specific predictions are made. 

### Models
- Regression
  - Regression analysis is a mathematical way of understanding which variables do have an impact on your business problem. Which factors matter most, and which can we ignore? 
  - General linear models (GLM)
  - But remember! Correlation does not mean causation!
- Trees
- Others


### Candidate models
**Not sure I know anything about candidate models, do these have another name? 
- Simple model
- Complex model
- Different model types


We can also build decision trees to make predictions about discrete or even continuous variables (depending on algorithm).

```{r eval=FALSE}
chicagofood_train %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  select(-ends_with("ID"), -LICENSE_DESCRIPTION, 
         -(Inspection_Date:License), -ends_with("Count"), -ends_with("Found")) %>%
  FFTrees(fail_flag ~ ., ., do.comp=FALSE) ->
  dtree_model
plot(dtree_model)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
if(!file.exists( "dtree.rds")){
chicagofood_train %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  select(-ends_with("ID"), -LICENSE_DESCRIPTION, 
         -(Inspection_Date:License), -ends_with("Count"), -ends_with("Found")) %>%
  FFTrees(fail_flag ~ ., ., do.comp=FALSE) ->
  dtree_model
saveRDS(dtree_model, "dtree.rds")
}
dtree_model<-readRDS("dtree.rds")
plot(dtree_model)
```

Amend this logistic regression model that predicts `fail_flag` to use three columns.

```{r simple-glm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
myglm<- glm(fail_flag ~ ageAtInspection + pastSerious, chicagofood , family="binomial")
```

## Evaluation
### Critical Success Factors
- False positives vs false negatives
  - Be wary of those results which may wrongly indacte that a particular attribute is or isn't present.
- Ranking
- Aligns with experts

Add predictions for test data.
```{r dtreefit, echo=TRUE}
chicagofood_test %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  add_predictions(dtree_model, "dtree") ->
  chicagofood_test
```

Add predictions for your glm to the test data.
```{r addpred, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.lines = 5}
```

```{r addpred-hint}
chicagofood_test %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  add_predictions(myglm, "glm") ->
  chicagofood_test
```

Build a confusion matrix to look at how well you classify the test data.
```{r echo=TRUE}
confusionMatrix(as.numeric(chicagofood_test$dtree), 
                chicagofood_test$fail_flag)
```

Apply the methodology to your glm results. Use the helper function `classify` to transofrm the glm output.

```{r echo=FALSE}
classify<-function(x) as.numeric(x>0)
```

```{r glmpred, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.lines = 5}
```

```{r glmpred-hint, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
confusionMatrix(classify(chicagofood_test$glm), 
                chicagofood_test$fail_flag)
```

### Data diving
- Segments
- Structural weaknesses
- Test data

### Getting started
#### Tips
- Don't just rely on single metric

## Operationalising
### Features
- ETL for new data and calculations
- What data quality stuff had to be done?

### Model
- How will you store the model?
- Does it need versioning?
- When will it need to be updated and how?

### Technology
- What's the easiest way of getting live?
- What's the long term way of getting it live?
- What's your "bus factor"?

```{r operationalisingquiz}
quiz(
  question("Which of these don't you need to take into account when operationalising models?",
    answer("Data availability"),
    answer("Update requirements"),
    answer("Sign-off"),
    answer("Model creation processes", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

### Getting started
#### Tips
- KISS
- Operationalising a model often takes longer than the modelling exercise (at least initially)

#### Next steps
- Check out R in SQL Server
